Cat1: [#smug, #mischevious] Finally awake?
Player1: Unfortunately.
Cat2: [#grinning] You look terrible.
Player1: Thanks. Real morale boost.
Cat1: No problem. You get that one for free.

Player1: [#groggy] What do you even want?
Cat2: [#mischevious] Oh, nothing. Just sitting here. Watching you waste away.
Player2: [#annoyed] I *just* woke up.
Cat2: [#smug] Exactly. That was already a struggle to witness.

Player1: [#sighs] You know, normal pets greet their owners with affection.
Cat1: [#grinning] And normal people wake up before noon.
Player2: You’re not a real cat, are you?
Cat2: [#mocking] Oh no, you got me. I’m actually a figment of your miserable little life.

Player1: Great. So I have a **talking** hallucination to deal with now.
Cat1: [#smug] Yep. And guess what?
Player1: What.
Cat2: You should check your emails.

Player2: Oh, *now* you care about my productivity?
Cat1: [#stretching] Someone has to.
Player1: You’re literally a cat.
Cat2: [#smug] And yet, I seem to have my life together more than you do.

Player2: Fine. I’ll check them. Not because *you* said so, but because I was going to anyway.
