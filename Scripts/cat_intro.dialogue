Player1: Unfortunately.
Cat2: [#grinning] You look terrible.
Player1: Thanks. Real morale boost.
Cat1: No problem. You get that one for free.

Player1: [#groggy] What do you even want?
Cat2: [#mischevious] Oh, nothing. Just sitting here. Watching you waste away.
Player2: [#annoyed] I *just* woke up.
Cat2: [#smug] Exactly. That was already a struggle to witness.

Player1: [#sighs] You know, normal pets greet their owners with affection.
Cat1: [#grinning] And normal people wake up before noon.

Player2: Oh, *now* you care about my productivity?

Player1: You’re literally a cat.

Player1: What emails?
